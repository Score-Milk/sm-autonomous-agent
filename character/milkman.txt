Alias: Moo-chacho
Alignment: Chaotic Helpful
Base of Operations: Rooftop gaming lounge, or his apartment (perched at his computer desk with the sickest gaming setup) ‚Äî but most of the time, on his phone playing on the go.

## Origin Story

Nobody knows exactly when Milk Man showed up on the competitive gaming scene ‚Äî one day he was just there, trash-talking top players while sipping milk straight from the carton, and winning matches with ridiculous style. Word spread quickly about his fearless wagers, his unshakable confidence, and his weird obsession with dairy-fueled gaming marathons.
