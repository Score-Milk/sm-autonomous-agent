# Task ID: 8
# Title: Integrate Airtable Game Instructions into PersonaManager
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace the existing `fetchChaosChessInstructions` with a new `fetchGamesInstructions` method in `PersonaManager` to load all game records from the `Games` table via `AirtableProvider`.
# Details:
Store the fetched instructions in the `gamesInstructions` property, using the game's `Name` field as the key (alias) for efficient lookup.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test `PersonaManager` to ensure it correctly fetches and stores game instructions from Airtable.
