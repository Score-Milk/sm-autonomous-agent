# Task ID: 13
# Title: Inject Platform Context into Agent Welcome Prompt
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Fetch the corresponding platform's data from `PersonaManager` based on the detected platform and update the `welcomePrompt` in `chat.ts`.
# Details:
Inject the platform's name and description into the agent's initial context, e.g., `[SYSTEM]: You are currently operating on the ${platform.name} platform. Here is a description of it: ${platform.description}`.

# Test Strategy:
Integration test the chat flow to ensure the welcome prompt correctly includes the dynamic platform context.
