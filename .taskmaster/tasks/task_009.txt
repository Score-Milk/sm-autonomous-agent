# Task ID: 9
# Title: Integrate Airtable Platform Data into PersonaManager
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement `fetchPlatformData` in `PersonaManager` to fetch all records from the `Platforms` table via `AirtableProvider`.
# Details:
Store the platform data in a way that allows for efficient lookup by the platform's `Official Website` URL, handling root domains and subdomains.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test `PersonaManager` to ensure it correctly fetches and indexes platform data from Airtable.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add platforms property to PersonaManager [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add a platforms property to store platform data for efficient URL-based lookup
### Details:
- Add a public platforms property to the PersonaManager class
- The property should be a Record<string, Platform> for efficient URL-based lookup
- Initialize it as an empty object in the constructor
- This will store platform data indexed by their URLs for quick access

## 2. Implement fetchPlatformData method [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a private method to fetch platform data from the personaLoader
### Details:
- Create a private async method called fetchPlatformData
- Call personaLoader.getPlatforms() to fetch platform data from Airtable
- Add proper error handling with try-catch block
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Return the fetched platform data

## 3. Implement URL-based platform indexing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a method to index platforms by URL for efficient lookup
### Details:
- Create a private method to process platform data and create URL-based index
- Handle both root domains and subdomains for flexible matching
- Store platforms indexed by their URLs in the platforms property
- Consider using URL normalization for consistent lookup
- Handle edge cases like missing URLs or invalid URLs

## 4. Integrate platform fetching into setup method [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update the setup method to fetch and process platform data
### Details:
- Add platform data fetching to the existing setup() method
- Call fetchPlatformData() and process the results
- Add proper error handling similar to personas and games
- Ensure platform data is refreshed along with other data on the refresh interval
- Add appropriate logging for platform data refresh

## 5. Add platform lookup utility method [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a public method to lookup platforms by URL
### Details:
- Create a public method like getPlatformByUrl(url: string) to find platforms by URL
- Handle URL normalization and matching logic
- Support both exact matches and domain-based matching
- Return the platform if found, null otherwise
- Add proper documentation and type safety
