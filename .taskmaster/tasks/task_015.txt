# Task ID: 15
# Title: Verify Airtable Integration and Periodic Refresh
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 13, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct comprehensive integration testing to ensure the entire Airtable refactor works as expected, including initial data loading and the periodic refresh mechanism.
# Details:
Verify that changes in Airtable are reflected in the application after the refresh interval. Monitor logs for any errors or warnings related to Airtable API interactions.

# Test Strategy:
End-to-end testing. Modify data in Airtable and observe application behavior. Simulate API downtime to check fallback.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create unit tests for AirtableProvider methods [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Write comprehensive unit tests for all AirtableProvider methods and error scenarios
### Details:
- Test authentication and configuration
- Test each table fetching method (Personas, Games, Platforms)
- Test error handling and retry logic
- Test caching mechanisms
- Test data transformation and validation
- Mock Airtable API responses for testing

## 2. Test PersonaManager integration with AirtableProvider [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify that PersonaManager correctly uses AirtableProvider for data fetching
### Details:
- Test PersonaManager initialization with AirtableProvider
- Verify data loading from all three tables (Personas, Games, Platforms)

## 4. Perform end-to-end integration testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing of the entire Airtable integration
### Details:
- Test complete flow from WebSocket connection to platform detection
- Verify data flows correctly through all components
- Test with real Airtable data (if available) or realistic mock data
- Test performance under load
- Verify all error scenarios are handled gracefully
- Test the complete user experience flow
